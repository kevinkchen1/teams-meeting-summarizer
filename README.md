# Microsoft Teams Meeting Summarizer

**Project Summary and Overview**


**Overview:**

In today's fast-paced work environment, effective communication is essential. However, the volume of information generated in meetings can overwhelm team members, especially when someone misses a session or needs to catch up later. The Meeting Transcript Summarizer, is designed to improve how organizations handle meeting transcripts, making them more accessible and actionable.

**Project Objective:**

My goal was to develop a user-friendly tool that automatically generates concise and actionable summaries from meeting transcripts. This tool will help teams save time, improve communication, and increase productivity by providing a clear overview of key discussion points and action items.

**Key Features and Components:**

1. **Transcript Retrieval:** The project incorporates the use of the Microsoft Graph API to seamlessly retrieve meeting transcripts from Microsoft Teams. This ensures a smooth integration with widely used collaboration tools.

2. **Summarization Algorithm:** Uses the OpenAI API, specifically ChatGPT, to break down lengthy transcripts into manageable sections and iteratively summarizes them until they are concise enough to be read efficiently. 

3. **Inclusion of Timestamps:** The summarizer includes timestamps, ensuring that users can quickly identify when specific topics were discussed during the meeting.

4. **Action Items:** The tool identifies and highlights action items, enabling participants to understand their responsibilities and follow up effectively.

5. **Teams Integration:** Summaries are automatically posted in the Teams channel chat at the end of the meeting, making them readily available to all participants.

**Benefits:**

- **Time Efficiency:** Participants can quickly catch up on missed meetings or revisit key points, saving valuable time.
  
- **Enhanced Communication:** Clear and concise summaries facilitate better communication by ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

- **Increased Productivity:** Action items are clearly outlined, leading to more effective follow-through and project progress.
